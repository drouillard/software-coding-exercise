# Coding Exercise

This coding exercise is part of the application process for Greenback's Software Development Internship.

## Instructions

Please create a 'Program' that parses the index.html file in this repository and generates the JSON found in results.json

* 'Program' can be a command line script, a web app or anything else that is easily runnable
* Please include instructions on how to run your 'Program'
* You are not restricted on languages or technologies you use. Greenback is primarily a Java shop, but Ruby, Python, JavaScript, etc. are all acceptable
* If you choose to do a web app you must take index.html as a form input parameter. Do not copy/paste index.html into a new html file along with your code and try to do a single page app.
